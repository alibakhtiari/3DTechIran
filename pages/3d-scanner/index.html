                        <p>What is 3D scanner?<br>
                            A 3D scanner is a device that analyzes objects in the real world or the surrounding
                            environment and collects data digitally based on its possible form and appearance. The main
                            purpose of a 3D scanner is to create a globular set of geometric samples from the surface
                            of a subject and simulate virtual objects.<br>
                            3D data collected for a wide range of applications is useful. The common uses of this
                            technology include industrial design, artificial intelligence, engineering and prototyping,
                            quality control and documentation of cultural artifacts.<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Reverse engineering is now one of the most commonly used methods in the industry, in which
                            a previously manufactured product is designed after a thorough review of the technical
                            design and changes, and the component is redone with consideration of these changes. In
                            this regard, the technical ability of engineers along with the use of advanced tools can
                            have an impact on the quality and speed of reverse engineering operations. An advanced 3D
                            scanning device () is one of the most powerful and new hardware in this field, which makes
                            it possible to make the new piece much faster, less costly and more accurate.by Using a 3D
                            scanner (), a variety of templates, replicas, or a piece in different dimensions and with
                            different applications can be provided, a three-dimensional design, and, if necessary,
                            using the relevant software, make the necessary changes to Create a scan file and finally
                            use a 3D scan file to work with industrial machines such as cnc, 3D printers, or lasers.<br>
                            The 3D scanner device () provides engineers or designers with an accurate,
                            three-dimensional piece of data from the available parts.<br>
                            Today, various industries require the use of 3D modeling. Including:<br>

                            The 3D scanner device provides engineers or designers with an accurate, three-dimensional
                            piece of data from the available parts.<br>
                            <br>
                            There are many different technologies to create a three-dimensional file of the object. In
                            a general category, scanners can be classified into contact and non-contact groups.
                            Non-contact scanners are divided into active and passive categories.<br>
                            Active non-contact scanner<br>
                            This type of scanner uses a beam of irradiation or light irradiation, and reflects such
                            beams to identify the object and its surroundings. Ultrasonic Sonic and X-ray is an example
                            of this type of scanner.<br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Three-dimensional triangular scanner</strong><br>
                            This kind of scanners uses linear or dot laser light and also uses a sensor or camera to
                            process a 3D scan. Collecting laser light reflected from the object by sensor or camera and
                            using the trigonometric computing system, the distance between the object and the scanner
                            is measured. The distance and the angle between the sensor and the laser source are clearly
                            and precisely defined. Depending on the laser beam reflected from the scan specimen, the
                            system can measure the angle of light to the sensor, resulting in the distance between the
                            light source and the surface of the object.<br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>3D scanner with structured light</strong><br>
                            This kind of scanners also uses a trigonometric computing system to measure distance.
                            Structured light scanners, instead of using a linear light or a laser point, stimulate the
                            scanning of structured linear patterns on the object's surface. . By scanning the edges of
                            each of the light lines of the pattern, the distance between the scanner and the surface of
                            the sample is calculated.<br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>3D flight scanner (time of flight)</strong><br>
                            This type of 3D scanner uses laser pulses to measure distance. The method of working on
                            this 3D scanner is based on a very simple physics concept. Since the speed of light is
                            specific and equal to the value of C, it is sufficient to calculate the length of time the
                            laser light travels from its source to reach the object and then to be recorded by the
                            sensor, until the distance of the light source to the surface of the object To come The
                            circuits used in this type of scanners have a precision measurement accuracy of a
                            pico-second.<br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Inactive Caller Scanner</strong><br>
                            These types of scanners do not emit any kind of rays, but rely on reflection of the ambient
                            light to detect the object. Most scanners in this category use visible light because they
                            are easily accessible. But other types of other rays, such as infrared rays, can also be
                            used to operate these scanners. Using this type of scanner is very cheap because it does
                            not require any special hardware other than a digital camera.<br>
